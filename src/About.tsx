        Hi, I’m Stephanos Kasoulides — a 23-year-old designer passionate about
        blending creativity with technology to craft meaningful digital
        experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Multimedia and Graphic Design from the
        Cyprus University of Technology, where I built a strong foundation in
        visual communication, design principles, and digital media. Currently, I
        am pursuing my Master’s degree in Interaction and Experience Design at
        the University of Limerick, further developing my skills in user-centered
        design, usability, and interactive systems.
        <br />
        <br />
        My work focuses on creating engaging, intuitive, and visually compelling
        experiences that not only look good but also feel natural and enjoyable
        to use. I am particularly interested in the intersection of design and
        technology — where storytelling, functionality, and aesthetics meet.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I’m not designing, I enjoy exploring new creative tools,
        experimenting with interactive media, and keeping up with the latest
        trends in UX and digital design.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m always excited to collaborate, share ideas, and push boundaries in
        the design space.
